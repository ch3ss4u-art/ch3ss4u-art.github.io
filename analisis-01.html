                    <h3>Defining the Approach</h3>
                    <p>I've been working on a framework for analyzing the video using the MDS model. I'm focusing on defining how the user's specific context, the video format, and the potential target audience shape the analysis. Currently, I'm thinking about the signifiers within the video, like the visual style or specific phrases.</p>

                    <h3>Focusing on Core Signifiers</h3>
                    <p>I'm now zeroing in on the analysis, shifting towards treating the core signifiers within the discourse as the entry point. The initial challenge, the absence of an obvious "slip," has led me to conceptualize the structural gap in the discourse itself as a form of "lapsus." This means the recurring, loaded terms will now be crucial for revealing the underlying narrative structure and the inherent contradictions between the "Real" and the "Symbolic."</p>

                    <h3>Isolating Core Elements</h3>
                    <p>I'm now zeroing in on this video. The woman's story, infused with New Age and karmic concepts, presents interesting signifiers. Her dream, featuring a "turquoise backpack" and a "policeman/Uber," becomes a nodal point in her experience. The interaction at the river, where she encounters the man and another woman, is key. I'm focusing on "Llama Gemela," "Kármica," and "Triángulos." I believe these are the crucial elements. I am applying MDS in the analysis.</p>

                    <h3>Examining Key Signifiers</h3>
                    <p>I'm now prioritizing "Llama" (flame/call) as the central signifier. This polysemic term is central to the woman's discourse. I'm focusing on "La Kármica," the disruptive element, as the starting point. The concept of fallido (failure) is crucial, as it marks the contradiction between the "Symbolic bond" and the "Real" encountered. I'm exploring how "Everything comes to light" connects to the "Llama" concept. I'm also considering deconstructing "Llama" phonetically.</p>

                    <h3>Deciphering Polysemy</h3>
                    <p>I'm now focusing on the polysemy of "Llama" and its role within the discourse. The woman's story, with its dream imagery of smoke, light, and calls to authority, is crucial. I'm unpacking the substitutions at play, with "Llama Gemela" potentially concealing a "failed call" or "burning flame," revealing a relationship marred by separation. The inherent contradictions are now more apparent.</p>

                    <h3>Dissecting Underlying Structures</h3>
                    <p>I'm now zeroing in on the underlying structures of jouissance. The river scene illustrates her need to see her exclusion. She enjoys the masochistic confirmation of betrayal, which the dream allows her to control. Her hysterical structure is apparent: she's questioning the Other and converting the man into a master, while the "Twin Flame" myth sutures the lack of a sexual relationship.</p>

                    <h3>Pinpointing Key Scission</h3>
                    <p>I'm now zeroing in on the concept of "Sueño / Realidad" (Dream / Reality) as the pivotal point within the subject's narrative. I see the subject treats the dream as a more accurate reflection of reality, with the physical encounter serving primarily as a validation of the dream's contents. The introduction of the signifier "Kármica" (karmic) is also significant as it serves to dehumanize and render the rival into an abstract concept of debt or lesson. I am also exploring how deconstructing "Todo sale a la luz" (Everything comes to light) phonetically leads to "Lapsus" / "Ilusion".</p>

                    <h3>Prioritizing the Nodal Signifier</h3>
                    <p>I'm now focusing on the polysemic nature of "Llama" (Flame/Call) as the nodal signifier, and the recent Christmas themes add another layer. It encapsulates the spiritual (Twin Flame), the dream (Smoke/Light), and the action (Calling Police/Uber). It perfectly bridges the Symbolic and the Real. I see her paranoia of betrayal in the discourse, justifying the obsessive stalking. The "Twin Flame" concept obscures the lack of a real relationship, which the "Karmic" figure ultimately fills.</p>

                    <h3>Unpacking Key Associations</h3>
                    <p>I'm now zeroing in on the "Uber en forma de policía" element. This juxtaposition is crucial, as the discourse attempts to integrate a rejection into the spiritual narrative. The police signify law and the super-ego, while the Uber suggests movement and transition. The subject's "awakened" self contrasts with the "sleeping/hiding" person, making it apparent how she's trying to make sense of the nonsense of rejection. I'm focusing on "Llama" as the action that is missing.</p>
